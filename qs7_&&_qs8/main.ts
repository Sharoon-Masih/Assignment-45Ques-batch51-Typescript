//7. Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results. 
console.log(`the addition is ${5}+${3} = `,5+3);
console.log(`the subtraction is ${10}-${2}= `,10-2);
console.log(`the multiplication is ${4}*${2}= `,4*2);
console.log(`the division is ${16}/${2}= `,16/2);
/*8. You should create four lines that look like this:

_____________________________________________

console.log(5 + 3)

_____________________________________________

Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.*/

console.log(5+3);
console.log(10-2);
console.log(4*2);
console.log(16/2);
